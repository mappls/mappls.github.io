An end-to-end Machine Learning project, for forecasting outcomes of football matches. It includes the stages of: data collection, cleaning, storage, processing, predictive modeling, model evaluation, statistical analysis and production deployment. 

There are two versions of this project:

- Old version - created mainly for learning purposes, built many tools from scratch;
- New version (under construction) - builds up on the gathered data, and will reconstruct the predictive modeling stage.
