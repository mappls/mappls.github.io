An end-to-end Machine Learning project I worked on for fun, and to learn the basics of ML. It includes the stages of: data collection, cleaning, storage, processing, predictive modeling, model evaluation, statistical analysis and production deployment. Most of the tools were built from scratch, such as this tiny <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mappls/NeuralNet">neural network</a> class.
