A group of Machine learning & Algorithms projects. It consists of over 20 smaller ML projects in Keras, TensorFlow or scikit-learn, and a few Python implementations of well-known algorithms and data structures. Projects are here grouped by tools used.


## Algorithms and data structures
Python implementations of the following:

- Binary Search Trees
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- HeapSort
- PriorityQueue
- LinkedList 

## Keras

Small projects in the form of Jupyter notebooks for:

- Sentiment classification with feed-forward neural networks;
- Multi-class sentiment classification with feed-forward neural nets;
- Sentiment classification with learned & pretrained word embeddings;
- Regression with neural networks and K-fold cross-validation on house price prediction;
- Image classification with ConvNets and augmentation;
- Image classification with pretrained ConvNets;
- Visualising intermediate activations in ConvNets;
- Visualising ConvNet filters;
- Visualising ConvNet class activations;
- Sentiment classification with recurrent neural nets (RNN & LSTM);
- Regression for temperature forecasting with feed-forward, recurrent and bi-directional neural nets;


## scikit-learn

A few short experiments in:

- Linear regression with different polynomial degrees;
- Naive Bayes & Support Vector Machine classification, Kmeans clustering;
- Data preprocessing (one-hot encoding, label encoding, etc.);

## TensorFlow

Short experiments in:

- Linear regression;
- Building a neural network;
