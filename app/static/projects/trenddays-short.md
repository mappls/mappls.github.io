A project for a US client on predicting a special "day type" in the stock market, as early as possible in the day. The main challenge was model optimization: pushing the limits of what a neural network can learn from small amount of data. We managed to achieve 74% precision and 53% recall, 3 hours after stock exchange opening hours.
