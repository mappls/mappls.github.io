This is a group of 20 small projects in a few different areas in Deep Learning, as part of the Specialization Programme <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deeplearning.ai">deeplearning.ai</a>. They include aspects from both Research and Applied deep learning domains.

The research domain included the implementation of the actual neural networks in Python like: the forward and back-propagation, loss functions and gradient descent optimization. These were coded for Feed-forward, Convolutional, and Recurrent neural nets. Then, a few important algorithms were implemented on top, such as: regularization (L2 and Dropout), initialisation, gradient checking, residual connections, batch normalization, YOLO, attention etc.

In the applied domain, the above networks were applied on problems like image classification, object detection, text generation, machine translation, sentiment classification, neural style transfer etc.
